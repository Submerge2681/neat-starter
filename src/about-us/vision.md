# 🎯 Our Vision

We envision a world of:

**⚖️ Justice**\
For all, especially those made most vulnerable by our current systems.

**✊🏾 Liberation**\
From the oppressive systems that operate through us, within us, upon us and upon our planet.\
\
**💚 Love**\
For ourselves, our communities, all living beings, and our planet. Through continual self-reflection, learning, and active engagement, we seek to hold ourselves, our communities and those in power accountable so that we embody this vision and move towards realizing it on our planet.
